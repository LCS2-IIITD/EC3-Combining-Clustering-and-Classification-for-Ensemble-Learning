# EC3-Combining-Clustering-and-Classification-for-Ensemble-Learning

EC3 is based on a principled combination of multiple classification and multiple clustering methods using an optimization function. The EC3 algorithm is a graph based maximization problem that deals with the meta output data of different classification algorithms. The baseline model that we choose to compare the algorithm against is BGCM, which is a model similar to the above algorithm. The new algorithm deals with a method proposed in the paper (Combination of Classification and Clustering Results with Label Propagation) for finding the bi-stochastic matrix from the given co-occurrence and membership matrix that we initially take as the input. Also we padded the Yg matrix that represents the probability distribution of Groups belonging to a particular class. We also did checks on the condition of Fo, Fg so that they should adhere to the bi-stochastic nature of the algorithm. We also did some pre-processing on the initial machine learning datasets to produce better results. The new generated ROC table is also included in the directory which shows the calculated auc score cpmparison for every dataset.
